# Manim Community Edition [¶](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/\#manim-community-edition "Link to this heading")

Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be
difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately.
Manim relies on Python’s simplicity to generate animations programmatically,
making it convenient to specify exactly how each one should run. Take a look
at the [Example Gallery](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html) for some inspiration on how to
create beautiful images and videos with Manim.

## First Steps [¶](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/\#first-steps "Link to this heading")

Are you new to Manim and are looking for where to get started? Then you are
in the right place!

Note

Please be aware that there are different, incompatible versions of Manim available.
ManimCE was forked from 3b1b/manim, originally created and open-sourced by Grant Sanderson, creator of \[3Blue1Brown\]( [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO\_jab\_esuFRV4b17AJtAw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)) educational math videos.
Check our [installation FAQ](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#different-versions)
to learn more!

- The [Installation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) section has the latest and
up-to-date installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
You can also find information on Manim’s docker images and (online)
notebook environments there.

- Want to try the library before installing it? Take a look at our
interactive online playground at [https://try.manim.community](https://try.manim.community/) in the form
of a Jupyter notebook.

- In our [Tutorials](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/index.html) section you will find a
collection of resources that will teach you how to use Manim. In particular,
the [Quickstart](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/quickstart.html) tutorial teaches you Manim’s basics,
and in [Manim’s building blocks](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/building_blocks.html) the classes used to compose
your animations are described in more detail.

## Navigating the Documentation [¶](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/\#navigating-the-documentation "Link to this heading")

Here are some short summaries for all of the sections in this documentation:

- The [Example Gallery](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html) is a collection of examples (rendered videos
and images together with the code they were generated from) that show a few different,
simple things that you can do with Manim.

- The [Installation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) section has information on installing Manim.

- In [Tutorials & Guides](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials_guides.html) you can find learning resources: proper
tutorials that guide you through the process of creating a video are in
the [Tutorial](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/index.html) section; guides on specific topics are in the
[Guides](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/index.html) section, and the answers to frequently asked questions
can be found in the [FAQ](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/index.html) section.

- The [Reference Manual](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference.html) contains a comprehensive list of all of Manim’s
(documented) modules, classes, and functions. If you are somewhat familiar with Manim’s
module structure, feel free to browse the manual directly. If you are searching for
something specific, feel free to use the documentation’s search feature in the sidebar.
Many classes and methods come with their own illustrated examples too!

- The [Plugins](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/plugins.html) page documents how to install, write, and distribute
plugins (that is, separate Python packages that extend the feature set of the core library).

- Changes between versions are documented in our [Changelog](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/changelog.html).

- If you are looking into contributing to the development of Manim, you can find information
on how to get involved in our [Contributing](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/contributing.html) section.
