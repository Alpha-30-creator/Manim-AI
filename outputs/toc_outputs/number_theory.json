      "description": "This subtopic introduces prime numbers, defining them as natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Key concepts include the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers. Common misconceptions include the belief that 1 is a prime number. Example problems will include identifying prime numbers within a range."
