      "description": "This subtopic introduces the fundamental concepts of probability and random variables. It defines probability, sample spaces, and events. The concept of a random variable is introduced, distinguishing between discrete and continuous random variables. Key properties of random variables will be discussed, along with examples of each type."

      "description": "This subtopic focuses on discrete probability distributions. It covers the definition of a probability distribution function (PDF) and introduces common discrete distributions such as the binomial and Poisson distributions. Key properties, including the calculation of probabilities and the use of the PDF, are explained with examples."
